# Online Chess Clock

An online chess clock to use to play with your friends. I build this project for fun. I use [Astro](https://astro.build/) on building this project.

This is a **Progressive Web Application** so you can install it on your local device.

**Note: I recommend viewing it on your phone since it may look weird if you try to view it on your desktop.**
